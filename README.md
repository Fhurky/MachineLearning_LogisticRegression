# MachineLearning_LogisticRegression

solver="liblinear"
Definition: This parameter specifies the algorithm used to optimize the logistic regression model.
Details: liblinear is an algorithm that works well for small datasets and is particularly suited for binary classification problems. It uses the liblinear library to train the model for linear classification.
Purpose: It provides a fast and efficient solution for small datasets or binary classification tasks.

C=0.001
Definition: The C parameter is the inverse of the regularization strength in logistic regression.
Details: C controls the amount of regularization applied to the model. A smaller C value applies stronger regularization, which simplifies the model (reduces the risk of overfitting). Conversely, a larger C value applies less regularization, allowing the model to fit the data more flexibly.
Purpose: With C=0.001, strong regularization is applied to minimize the risk of overfitting. However, this might also reduce the model's overall performance because the model could become too simplistic and may not capture the complexity of the data.
These parameters help balance the model's learning process and its ability to generalize. A low C value and the liblinear solver encourage the model to find a simpler, more general solution.
